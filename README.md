I. Notes:
1. midxing.py is the python sourse code for the solutions to the midterm exam

2. 7 yearly html pages were requested and saved in the folder "html_files"

3. links are extracted by those 7 html pages and saved in the folder "parsed_files"

4. every movie's website was downloaded and saved in the folder "deep_link_html"

6. The final output is "final_output.csv"


II. Code explanations:
1. From line 1 to line 10: extracted 7 html files from the website, here I did not use a loop because there are only 7 pages.

2. From line 14 to Line 41: extracted all the links and saved the links to the csv file "dataset_names11.csv"

3. From line 45 to 48: eliminated the duplicates and saved to "dataset_names12.csv"

4. Used Excel to clean the data and saved it to "dataset_names234.csv"

5. From line 54 to line 75: extracted each movie's website and saved those html files into folder "deep_link_html"

6. From line 80 to line 102: parsed the data from those website pages and saved the data into "dataset_two.csv"

7. From line 105 to line 109: cleaned the dataset and saved it to the final output "final_output.csv"
